# SearchSortExperiment

This repository contains implementations of classic search and sort algorithms 
in Python to help students empirically determine growth of worst case running 
time.

usage: `searchsort.py <algorithm> <listSize>`

`algorithm` One of `linear binary` searches or  `bubble merge insert` sorts

`listSize` An integer from 10 to 1,000,000,000 representing the size of the listSize

The application will print out the number of seconds it took the algorithm to 
run on the given list size.
